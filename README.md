U.S. Couples' Money Arrangements
  
This repository analyzes data from the [National Couples' Health and Time Study](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/DSDR/studies/38417).
It creates a visualization of 2020-2021 estimates of couples' (n = 3,537) money arrangements 
by marital status, parental status, age group, and for different-gender and same-gender couples.
